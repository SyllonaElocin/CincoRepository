The setting up of the project and django was an easy one. However, the use of git was a new experience and it was frustrating because of unfamiliar terms that were needed to learn like commit and push. The biggest challenge for this part was the credentials used for pushing as they dont match with my inputted credentials but the previous owner of the desktop I currently use. Despite trying to change the username and email, it always results in the same account being the one used whenever I make a push. I just hope that using git in the future where I get to become more experienced in using it is not as frustrating as my first time.
